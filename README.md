# Top_Tech_S-P_500_Forecasting
Forecasting the stock market is difficult. I sought to observe 
the relationship between Apple's stock price and others in the
S&P500. In doing this, I was able to conclude that stocks in a 
related industry can help predict a trend in Apple's
Percent change. Using this, I went on to use a VAR model to
help accommodate this relationship and actually forecast
the next quarter. From this, I tested the VAR model versus the
Arima model to ensure that using stocks in the related field 
is significant to not.
