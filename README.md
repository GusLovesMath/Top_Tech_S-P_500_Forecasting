# Top_Tech_S-P_500_Forecasting
Forecasting the stock market is difficult. I sought to observe 
the relationship between Apple's stock price and others in the
S&P500. In doing this, I was able to conclude that stocks in the 
tech industry can help predict a trend in Apple's
Percent change. Using this, I went on to use a VAR model to
help accommodate this relationship and actually forecast
the next quarter. From this, I tested the VAR model versus the
Arima model to ensure that using stocks in the related field 
is significant or not.

Also note that the dataset uploaded is not the same one used.
The version shared here is a cleaned version consisting of only
the top ten tech stocks in the S&P500 based on average volume. 
A link to the orignal data set is below.

A teanty five page paper was written that goes in-depth on the anaylsis portion
of the data analysis and modeling. If you would like to read it please contact me.
